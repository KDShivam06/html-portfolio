<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Shivam Khamkar an engineering student at PICT Pune, driven by curiosity, shaped by resilience, and always building toward something greater.</p>

<p>I've cleared some of India's most competitive exams, including NTSE, JEE Advanced, and the Maharashtra State Scholarship. I began my academic journey at IIT Dhanbad and now pursue Electronics and Computer Engineering at PICT. My focus lies in building deep technical skills, especially in areas like AI, backend systems, and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>I approach learning with intensity not just aiming to understand concepts, but to apply them in real world projects and build a portfolio that reflects impact. Whether it's learning new programming languages, solving problems, or exploring new technologies, I believe in pushing beyond limits with consistency and clarity.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I'm committed to fitness, long term thinking, and personal growth and I believe in earning results, not excuses.</p>
